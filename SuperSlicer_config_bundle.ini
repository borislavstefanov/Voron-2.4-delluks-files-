notes = \nPretty PLA for those rocking Linear Advance 1.5 firmwares. I got you!\n\nSo any Prusa MK3 or MK3s running custom linear advance 1.5 firmware this is a great starting point.\n\nAll the new benefits like better mesh bed leveling without the oozing, better supports, and tweaks not found in other profiles all here in one.\n\nShout out to all the smart humans who spent all their time helping make this happen and for making this the #1 non Prusa made profile used in the community.\n\nSummary and Profile created by Chris Warkocki
